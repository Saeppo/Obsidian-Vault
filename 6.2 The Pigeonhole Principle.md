**"How many people do I need to consider to definitely find two people that have their birthdays on the same day?"** 3
    
- The answer is $k+1 = 366$. The principle guarantees the _existence_ of a pair, but it doesn't tell you _which_ day it is.
        
**"How many people do I need to consider to definitely find two people that have birthday on February 13 (Dirichlet's birthday)?"** 4
    
- The answer is _much_ larger or impossible to guarantee with certainty, because the principle doesn't guarantee a specific box (day) will be chosen. It only guarantees _a_ box will have two or more.

## **Subsequence:** 
A sequence formed by deleting some terms from the original sequence5. For example, in the sequence $5, 2, 0, 7, 1$, the sequence $5, 7, 1$ is a subsequence.

A sequence {a ′ n} is called a subsequence of a sequence {an} if {a ′ n} emerges from {an} by deleting terms. 
Let n ≥ 1 be an integer. 
Claim: Any sequence of n 2 + 1 distinct numbers contains a strictly increasing subsequence or a strictly decreasing subsequence of length n + 1.
### Example Inceasing: 
5, 2, **0**, 7, **1**, 4, 9, **3**, 8, **6** 
### Example Decreasing: 
10, 6, **12**, 3, 14, **7**, **5**, 16, 1, **4**, 13, 11, 0, 9, **2**, 15, 8
## **Strictly Increasing:** 
Each term is larger than the one before it (e.g., $2, 4, 7$).
    
## **Strictly Decreasing:** 
Each term is smaller than the one before it (e.g., $9, 6, 3$).
    
For **Example 1** on the slide: $5, 2, 0, 7, 1, 4, 9, 3, 8, 6$.

- The length of this sequence is 10.
- If we choose $n=3$, then $n^2 + 1 = 3^2 + 1 = 10$.
- The claim states that this sequence must contain a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing subsequence of length $n+1 = 4$.


# Erdős-Szekeres theorem
Let's define a pair of numbers for every term $a_k$ in the sequence:

- $i_k$: The length of the longest **increasing** subsequence that _ends_ at $a_k$.
    
- $d_k$: The length of the longest **decreasing** subsequence that _ends_ at $a_k$.
    
Every term $a_k$ in the sequence is an **object** ($N=n^2+1$). The boxes are the possible pairs of lengths $(i_k, d_k)$.

# Generalized Pigeonhole Principle (GPP)
![[Pasted image 20251201223010.png]]
In our scenario, we knew the number of boxes ($k=10$) and the required minimum objects per box ($m=3$). We needed to find $N$.

The general formula to find the minimum number of objects $N$ required to guarantee at least $m$ objects in one of the $k$ boxes is:

$$N_{min} = k \cdot (m - 1) + 1$$
$k=10$ (boxes)
$m=3$ (minimum required)
$N_{min} = 10 \cdot (3 - 1) + 1 = 10 \cdot 2 + 1 = 21$.
## 📝 Combinatorial Rules Review

These rules govern basic counting operations1111.

### ➕ Sum and Subtraction Rules (Slide 2)

- The Sum Rule: For disjoint (mutually exclusive) finite sets $S_{1},S_{2},...,S_{n}$ where $S_{i}\cap S_{j}=\emptyset$ for any $i\ne j$2, the size of their union is the sum of their sizes:
    
    $$|\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}S_{i}|=\sum_{i=1}^{n}|S_{i}|$$
- The Subtraction Rule (Inclusion-Exclusion for two sets): For any finite sets $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$, the size of their union is:
    
    $$|S_{1}\cup S_{2}|=|S_{1}|+|S_{2}|-|S_{1}\cap S_{2}|$$
### ✖️ Product and Division Rules (Slide 3)

- The Product Rule: For any finite sets $S_{1},S_{2},...,S_{n}$5, the number of elements in their Cartesian product (sequences of choices) is the product of their sizes:
    
    $$|S_{1}\times S_{2}\times\cdot\cdot\cdot\times S_{n}|=|S_{1}|\cdot|S_{2}|\cdot...\cdot|S_{n}|$$
- The Division Rule: If a finite set $A$ is partitioned into $n$ disjoint subsets $B_1, \dots, B_n$ (i.e., $A=\bigcup B_i$) 7, and every subset has the same size $|B_i|=d$8, then the number of subsets $n$ is:
    
    $$n = |A|/d$$

## 🕊️ The Pigeonhole Principles

These principles guarantee the _existence_ of a certain outcome if the number of objects exceeds the number of categories.

### 1. The Pigeonhole Principle (PCP) (Slides 11, 20)

- **Definition (Theorem 6.2.1):** Let $k\ge1$ be an integer. When $k+1$ or more objects ($N \ge k+1$) are placed into $k$ boxes, there is at least one box that contains at least two of the objects10101010.
    
- **Corollary 6.3.1 (Function Mapping):** A function $f:M\rightarrow N$ where the domain $|M|$ is an integer larger than the codomain $|N|$ is **not one-to-one** (injective)11.
    

### 2. The Generalized Pigeonhole Principle (GPP) (Slides 17, 20)

- **Definition (Theorem 6.2.2):** Let $N, k\ge1$ be integers. When $N$ or more objects are placed into $k$ boxes, there exists at least one box that contains a minimum of $m$ objects12.
    
- Minimum Guaranteed Occupancy ($m$): The number of objects guaranteed in at least one box is:
    
    $$m = \left\lceil \frac{N}{k} \right\rceil$$
    
    13
    
    - _Where:_ $N$ = objects (pigeons), $k$ = boxes (pigeonholes).
        
- Minimum Required Objects ($N_{min}$): To guarantee at least $m$ objects in one of the $k$ boxes, you need:
    
    $$N_{min} = k \cdot (m - 1) + 1$$
